# An ESL App for English Language Learners

This is the beginnings of a language learning app for ESL language learners.  There is only one lesson, but this could be expanded to greater and greater difficulty.

### Philosophy of Education

This app was built with the idea that the best way to learn a language is through practice and constant repetition rather than through a great deal of explanation.  The purpose is to give the learner as little explanation as is necessary in order to understand the lesson.  This is so that they may move onto practice activities as soon as possible.  The user then goes through receptive activies such as choosing items from a list or listening to the sentences which are produced through text to speech.  The user then moves onto more difficult productive activites such as writing and speaking.  The computer checks the accuracy of the users speech through vocal recognition.

Since this is a beginner lesson, we start with the learner memorizing a simple conversation and then going through several practice activities that get progressively more difficult.

## Activities

### Practice Activities

The practice acitivies increase in difficulty as the learner progresses.

We start with drop down fill in the blank activites followed by fill in the blanks where the user needs to type out the missing words in the answer.  We finish off with user completing nearly the entire sentence alone.

It is always important to ensure that the learners learn both the questions as well as the responses, so similar activities are included for the questions.

### Chat Activities

The chat activitivities ask the user the produce the entire sentence and question of their own accord.  This is increasing the difficulty slowly.  The chat app is also a cool looking application that appears as a Facebook style chat app.  This helps to show that language is used in real life.

### Listening and Speaking Activities

The computer uses text to speech to produce the sentence using a mechanical voice to give the user listening practice.

The computer uses speech recogintion to interpret what the user said and verify their accuracy and pronunciation was accurate.
