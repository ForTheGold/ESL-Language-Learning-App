# An ESL App for English Language Learners

This is the beginnings of a language learning app for ESL language learners.  There is only one lesson, but this could be expanded to greater and greater difficulty.

### Philosophy of Education

This app was built with the idea that the best way to learn a language is through practice and constant repetition rather than through a great deal of explanation.  The purpose is to give the learner as little explanation as is necessary in order to understand the lesson.  This is so that they may move onto practice activities as soon as possible.  The user then goes through receptive activities such as choosing items from a list or listening to the sentences which are produced through text to speech.  The user then moves onto more difficult productive activities such as writing and speaking.  The computer checks the accuracy of the user's speech through vocal recognition.

Since this is a beginner lesson, we start with the learner memorizing a simple conversation and then going through several practice activities that get progressively more difficult.

## Practice Activities

We start off with relatively easy practice activities and the activities increase in difficulty as the learner progresses.  We also start off with more receptive activities and then move onto productive activities as the learner gets more familiar with the material.

### Learning Tab

The first thing the user does is simply read and memorize a conversation that is printed on the screen which can viewed in the following image.  You can also see the navigation bar across the top which is used to navigate through the site.



### Response Practice Tab

We start the user off with practicing the responses through progressively more difficult activities.  The first activity is a drop down fill in the blank activity followed by fill in the blanks where the user needs to type out the missing words in the answer.  We finish off with the user completing nearly the entire sentence alone.  These activities can be viewed below.



### Question Practice Tab

It is always important to ensure that the learners learn both the questions as well as the responses, so similar activities are included for the questions.  We start off with a drop down fill in the blank activity, then move onto a fill in the blank where one word per a sentence needs to be typed out and finish off with the user typing out nearly the entire sentence.  These activities can be viewed below.



### Chat Activities

The chat activities ask the user to produce the entire response and question of their own accord.  This is increasing the difficulty slowly.  The chat app is also a cool looking application that appears as a Facebook style chat app.  This helps to show that language is used in real life.  This activity can be viewed below



### Listening and Speaking Activities

The computer uses text to speech to produce the sentence using a mechanical voice to give the user listening practice.  This is activated by clicking the “Click me!” link on the right hand side of the sentence as shown below.



The computer uses speech recognition to interpret what the user said and verify the accuracy of the sentence they produced as well as their pronunciation.  This type of practice activity is included for both the responses and the questions as shown below.  The user can click the microphone icon on the right side of the input box and the browser will begin recording.
